        <p id= "frist_p"> There are many sports car out there but only one catch my attention. The Dodge Challenger, it is one of the best looking sports car out there in my opion. I was not a fan of the older models but the new models from 2014 and up are very nice looking. I have never drove one personally but I've watched videos on youtube and I can tell that it would be a fun drive for anyone who owns one. There are many models but I believe the basic model which I think is the SRT comes with the standard 305-hp 3.6-liter V-6 engine and an eight-speed auto, it also comes with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 makes 375 hp when paired with the standard six-speed manual and 372 hp with the optional eight-speed automatic. The other models provide more luxurious features. </p>

                <p> The interior of the car just look so amazing, The Dashboard itself does all the talking. They redesigned the new steering wheel and dashboard. the shifting gear is redesigned as well. The have the aut0matic shifter slash manual sifter. The stereo system is now touchscreen and it come standard in all the models. The seats come standard with leather seats and different colors. They have rad and black, white and black, orange and black etc. The dodge challenger have two rear seats in the back, in order to transport two more passenges. the only downside about the rear seat is that there isn't much leg room for the backseat passengers, but besides that I believe that is a really nice and fun car to have.  </p>

                <p> The exterior of the Dodge Challenger has a mean look to it. The front headlights of the 2016 models come standard with LED light. The tail lights are LED as well. The front of the car just have an amazing look from looking at it far away. The tires on the dodge challenger comes in 18-20 diameter, with a  7.5-9.5 width according to google. </p>
